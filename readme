I Created a tool to transefer files between between two Laptop(or desktop) to mobile or vice versa via Wi-files

to use This tool:
step1: #setup the files
   1)clone it `git clone https://github.com/bydefaultcoder/wifi-folder-viewer.git` (it will better if you clone it in desktop)
   2)setup System Environment variable 
      `System environment variable > click on new (open imag1) > as imag write "sharefile" in veriable name`
            `and in the variable value write path of FileShare.bat` 
            `in my case it is "C:\Users\proje\Desktop\experiment_all\wifi-folder-viewer\FileShare.bat" (open imag2) `
   3)go to folder "wifi-folder-viewer" run setup.bat
