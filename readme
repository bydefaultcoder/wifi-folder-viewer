I Created a tool to transefer files between between two Laptop(or desktop) to mobile or vice versa via Wi-files

to use This tool:
step1: #setup the files
   1)clone it `git clone https://github.com/bydefaultcoder/wifi-folder-viewer.git` (it will better if you clone it in desktop)
   2)go to folder "wifi-folder-viewer" run `setup.bat` (img1) (in CMD not PowerShell)
   3)setup System Environment variable 
       > System environment variable 
       > select path (img3)
       > then click on edit (img4)
       > click on new (img5)
       > copy & paste the path of the folder (img2) (in my case it is "C:\Users\proje\Desktop\experiment_all\wifi-folder-viewer" ) (img7)

step2:#how to use it
    go to folder where to use it (jis jagah ki file tumko mobile m copy karni h)
    open powershell using shift + RightMouseClick (img8)
    write `cmd` (img9) then `fileshare` (img10)
